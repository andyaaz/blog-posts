## Problem

Last week I was trying to set up Google Analytics for my project and I knew that Google Tag manager might also be worth trying as it centralizes and bootstraps all your tags so that you can not only use Goolge Analytics but also other tools from Google on your site.

However, such a common and supposedly easy task took me a while to figure out what the most up to date solution is as Google keeps updating their products and result of a simple search on the internet could be overwhelming for some people. Here's the solution I am using and I think is up to date.

## End Result

Go to website you are tracking and you should see statistics in your google analytics (so that you can see at least there is one visitor, yourself)

In your Google Tag Manager, you should see a tag of type "Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration"
