## My general background

## My AWS background

## What I bought/prepared

- Bought practice exams for each exam from [Tutorials Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/)
  **_disclaimer: I have NO affiliation with courses I mentioned_**

## How I studied

### Solutions Architect Associate exam date - Mar 14

- Prep Start Date: Feb 15
- Feb 15 - 28: I watched the entire Adrian's SAA course. 13 days seems pretty tight for a course that contains 300+ videos and some demos. However, 2x speed plus selectively doing demos made it the process much shorter and more focused. I did about 20% demos (I got lazy towards the middle of the course and skipped ones that I have experience with or aren't included in free tier)
- Feb 28 - Mar 14: I did about 60% of Tutorials Dojo's practice exams. I got an averge score of 86 in timed mode which I did right before the real exam.

### Developer Associate exam date - Apr 8

- Prep Start Date: Mar 21
- Mar 21 - Mar 28: I watched some of Adrian's SAP course for topics that I need a deep understanding of. I went back to SAA and did about another 20% demos in SAA or just played with services to just test things out.
- Apr 2 - Apr 8: I did 33% of practice exams. I actually did 2 exams on the same day that I did the real one. I got an average score of 83 for timed practice exams. This score is quite interesting enough, cause I had one practice exam that I scored only 55. otherwise I would have gotten an average of 90. So after getting 55 I realized there were couple services I knew very little about. I spent 2-3 hours studying those questions and answers before I took another practice exam. Then later I scored 100 and 93 in another two exams. I was sure that I was ready for the real one.
