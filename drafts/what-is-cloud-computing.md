- board network access (internet access)
- resource pool (more people share pool of resources, better value)
- rapid elasticity (scale up/down/in/out fast)
- measured service (pay as you go)

Types

- private cloud (e.g. aws outputs, azure stack, gcp anthos)
- hybrid cloud (public and private)
- multi cloud (multiple cloud vendors)
