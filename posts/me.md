Hello, world!

My name is An Zheng and I go by Andy as it is easier for non-Mandarin speakers to call me. I also speak "meh" Cantonese.

I studied education in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) for 5 years at The Education University of Hong Kong and decided to pursue a career in software engineering despite that [teachers are paid really well](https://www.csb.gov.hk/english/admin/pay/42.html) (engineers not as much). In the past, I always thought that having a non-CS degree is a burden or something you need to hide when talking to people in the industry because it is often a sign of a shaky foundation and not being able to think logically or "computationally". There's some truth to that. But everyone has the same amount of time and it means that you invest yours in something else (non-CS stuff) that could also be helpful in some ways in software engineering. In particular, education in education (for lack of a better way to say it...) has made me:

1. more empathetical
   I try my best not to judge one's learning ability (no matter how slow one learns) when I am teaching or explaining and be as patient as possible. (sometimes it's sooo tempting to say "I said xxx 3 times already and how is it humanly possible for anyone to not get it")
2. present ideas more clearly
   I try not to say anything before I have thoughts organized in my mind and till I know when it is ready to present them. It is easy to create confusion and hard to make things clear.
   (1, 2 also known as professionalism in teaching)
3. more extroverted
   I believe that one cannot achieve great things by themselves and exchanging ideas often with people is always important.

All of the above are in no way saying that I am an expert in any of those things and as a matter of fact, I find myself getting worse at them as I work longer in the industry(so I put them on the home page to remind myself). It is just a very brief list of benefits when you spend 5 years studying education theories.

Long story short, now somehow I am proud that I am making good progress just by googling things every day and being more of a whole person/engineer who knows how to communicate effectively and behave professionally.

I post things here 2, 3 times bi-weekly and hope you find some of them useful/interesting.
